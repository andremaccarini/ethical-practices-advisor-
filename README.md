# 🧭 Ethical Practices Advisor (Compliance Recommender)

## 📚 Description

This is a simple command-line tool built in **Python** that provides compliance recommendations tailored to specific business sectors. It reads from a structured JSON file and allows users to interactively consult best practices for different industries. The project reflects the intersection between data, ethics, and automation — a core element of my background in law and corporate governance.
